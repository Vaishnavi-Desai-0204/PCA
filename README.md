# PCA

The code performs Principal Component Analysis (PCA) on a given dataset. It first computes the covariance matrix of the data and then finds the principal components and their corresponding eigenvalues. It also includes functions to project the data onto the selected principal components and plot the original and projected data. PCA is a commonly used dimensionality reduction technique in machine learning and data analysis.
